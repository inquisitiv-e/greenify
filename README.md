## Inspiration

Being an environmentally responsible consumer is hard.

People nowadays spend a lot of time searching for reliable products. There is a lot of eco-friendly merchandise out there, but the general audience is not aware of the products and/or don't want to spend a lot of their time to do research.

greenify is a curation platform to remove the hurdle for consumers - it's a **green** marketplace to **greenify** our lives.

## What it does

greenify does not rely on charities or donation. greenify makes a profit by performing as a retailer and use the profit to greenify the earth.

greenify:

- curates eco-friendly products and companies
- connects people to environment-friendly products
- encourages people to learn more about the environment by collecting seeds for discount

## How we built it

We developed the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into

Learning new technologies was challenging. We learnt new things and built this project with new knowledge. This was our first use of Firebase and one member learned HTML and CSS yesterday. Learning by doing is not the easiest thing in the world, but we're glad that we made it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our awesome teamwork!
